    <h2 style="color: antiquewhite;">Introduction </h2>
    <p style="color: antiquewhite;">Onam, the vibrant and cultural festival of Kerala, is celebrated with great zeal and enthusiasm across the state. A unique and captivating aspect of Onam is the way it fosters unity, cultural diversity, and a sense of camaraderie among people. "Aaravam," the Onam celebration in our college, encapsulates the spirit of this festival and brings together students from various backgrounds to rejoice in the rich traditions of Kerala.

        he air is filled with excitement as the campus prepares to welcome "Aaravam." Colorful floral rangolis, or "Pookalam," adorn the entrances, each one a masterpiece crafted by the artistic hands of our students. These intricate designs not only add to the festive ambience but also symbolize the prosperity and unity that Onam stands for.

    <h2 style="color: antiquewhite;">Onam:Essence of nature</h2>
    <p style="color: antiquewhite;">One of the highlights of "Aaravam" is the grand feast, or "Sadya," which is a culinary extravaganza showcasing the authentic flavors of Kerala. The aroma of freshly cooked curries, the sound of sizzling spices, and the sight of numerous dishes beautifully arranged on banana leaves create an atmosphere of joy and anticipation. The feast is a unifying experience where everyone, regardless of their background, comes together to savor the delicious food and celebrate the spirit of togetherness.

        Cultural performances are another integral part of "Aaravam." Students present traditional dances like "Thiruvathira" and "Kaikottikali," showcasing the rich heritage of Kerala. The graceful movements, colorful costumes, and rhythmic beats of these dances captivate the audience and transport them to the heart of Kerala's cultural landscape.
